Repository and Migrations
	
	- This repository contains the database migration scripts and the repository implementation for the project. The migrations are used to manage the database schema and data changes over time, while the repository provides an interface for interacting with the underlying data storage.

Migrations

Prerequisites

	- Ensure that you have the required database server installed (SQL Server).
	- Configure the connection string in the project's configuration file to point to the appropriate database server.

Applying Migrations

To apply the migrations and set up the initial database schema, follow these steps:
 
	1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
	2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
	3. Run the following command to apply the migrations: dotnet ef database update
		- This command will execute the migration scripts and create or update the database schema
		  accordingly.
	4. Verify that the database has been created or updated successfully.

Creating New Migrations

If you need to make changes to the database schema or data model, follow these steps to create a new
migration:

	1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
	2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
	3. Run the following command to create a new migration: dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
		- Replace '<MigrationName>' with a descriptive name for the migration. Choose a name that reflects the purpose of the migration, such as "AddUsersTable" or "UpdateProductSchema".
	4. Implement the necessary changes in the migration script generated by the Entity Framework Core
	   tooling.
	5. Run the migration using the 'dotnet ef database update' command to apply the changes to the
	   database.

Repository

	- The repository pattern is used to provide a standardized way of accessing and manipulating data in the project. It encapsulates the data access logic and provides an abstraction layer between the business logic and the underlying data storage.

Repository Interface

	- The repository interface defines the contract for interacting with the data. It specifies the methods available for performing CRUD operations and querying the data.

Repository Implementation

	- The repository implementation contains the actual logic for executing the data access operations defined in the repository interface. It utilizes the database context and entities to perform the required operations, such as fetching data, creating new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.
