Services

	- Services play a crucial role in implementing the business logic and providing the necessary functionality to interact with the underlying data and external dependencies. They encapsulate complex operations, coordinate data access, and enforce business rules.

Purpose

The services in this project serve the following purposes:

	- Business Logic: They implement the business rules and logic necessary for the application to function correctly and deliver the expected functionality.
	- Data Access: They interact with data repositories or data access layers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data objects.
	- Integration: They handle integrations with external systems, such as APIs, third-party services, or external databases.
	- Validation: They validate input data, enforce data integrity rules, and perform necessary checks before processing or persisting the data.
	- Error Handling: They handle exceptions and errors smoothly, providing meaningful error messages and appropriate error handling strategies.

Service Structure

	- Each service represents a specific domain or functionality within the project. It typically consists of methods or operations that perform specific tasks related to that domain. Services may rely on other services, repositories, or external dependencies to accomplish their tasks.
